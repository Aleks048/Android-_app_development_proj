# TopHillHotelManagement

**SEG2105 Final Project**

It's a mobile hotel management application that runs on Android meant to help our client TopHill Suites Hotel to improve its management more efficiently. Since, mobile phones are everywhere and employees use them even during their work shifts :) Why not make good use of it?
This application will manage all aspects of a hotel and will divide it in multiple departments such as Reception, Room Service, Restaurant, Transportation (Shuttles, ect.)
There are three levels of access to the app. One for the Hotel Manager (The Big Boss), one for a Department Manager (Manages only his department) and one for the Receptionist.
Yours to discover the plenty of features in this app by downloading cloning this project and opening the app in Android Studio.
